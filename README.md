# FREDC-chinese-few-shot-RE
A Chinese few-shot relation extraction dataset and some baseline models
FREDE is a specialized dataset for few-shot RE based on Chinese text. FREC integrates and enhances existing high-quality Chinese information extraction datasets, encompassing nearly one hundred types of relations across general, medical, and financial domains. This extensive coverage makes FREC can apply the various challenges faced in few-shot RE tasks. To assess the effectiveness of the FREC, we performed experiments with several few-shot RE models and obtained meaningful results.
